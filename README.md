# Great site.

As promised, I documented the time of work. In total, this project took 43 hours and 42 minutes, but we must take into account the fact that in the process of work I simultaneously studied and learned new technologies. Here I interacted with HTML and CSS, JS, JQuery, semantic markup, BEM (Block-Element-Modifier), Bootstrap SlickSlider and many others.
